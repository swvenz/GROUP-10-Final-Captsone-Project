<h1>Final Captsone Project: Sales and Inventory Management System </h1>
<h3>Project Documentation for the Final Capstone Project in Computer Programming 2</h3>

- 🔭 We're the Group 10 of BSIT 1-1, currently working on our capstone project: **Sales and Inventory Management System (SIMS)**
- 🌱 We're currently learning **Python**

The Sales & Inventory System is a Python-based application designed to help small businesses and students manage product records, monitor inventory levels, and track sales transactions efficiently. The system uses Excel files as its database, allowing users to store and access product, sales, and inventory movement data in a simple and familiar format.

This system enables users to add new products, view existing inventory, record sales, and restock items. Each time a sale or restock is recorded, the program automatically updates the product’s stock quantity and logs the transaction in separate Excel files for sales and inventory movements. This ensures that inventory levels remain accurate and up to date at all times.

The system also includes a built-in low-stock alert feature that identifies products whose stock quantity has reached or fallen below their reorder level. This helps users avoid running out of items and supports better purchasing and inventory planning. By automating stock updates and maintaining organized records, the system improves accuracy, reduces manual errors, and makes day-to-day inventory management more efficient and reliable.

<b>The system allows users to:</b>
- View available products
- Add new products
- Record sales transactions
- Restock existing products
- Automatically updates stock levels
- Low-stock alerts are displayed to help users know when products are running out.

<b>vSystem Requirements:</b>
- To run this program, you need:
- A computer with Windows
- Python installed
- equired Excel Files in the same folder
- Python libraries
